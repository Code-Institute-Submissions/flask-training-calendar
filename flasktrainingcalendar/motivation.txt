Go Eat That Buritto!
Feeling Bored? Plan a Run!
Rest Up, Plenty of Runs Coming Up!
Got a Race Booked?
Doesn't matter how slow you go, you're lapping everyone on the couch!
Don't forget to upload those sweaty workout photos!
Isn't there a PR you should be working on?
How're those Quads?
Those intervals aren't going to run themselves!
What's the farthest you've run? Sure you couldn't go a little further?
I run for beer! How about you?
Following someone who has added a workout? Why not add your own better workout!
If it doesn't challenge you, it won't change you!
If you fail to prepare, you're prepared to fail!
Don't stop when you're tired, stop when you're done!
Run often, run long. But never outrun your joy of running!
I love running...when I'm done!
Blisters are braille for awesome!
The faster you run, the sooner you're done!
I run better than the government!
Run like there are free Tacos at the finish line!
I run because I really like pizza!
Run in the morning, before your brain figures out what you're doing!
Scientific fact: Running any given route in the rain makes you feel 50% more hardcore than covering the same route on a sunny day!
Please stop asking me what I'm doing this weekend. Running. I'm Running. This weekend. Next weekend. Every weekend. Forever!
